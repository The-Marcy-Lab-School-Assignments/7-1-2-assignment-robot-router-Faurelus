# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

The path `/products/:id` will match options 3 (`/products/5`) and 4 (`/products/5/about`) because they include a segment (5) that fits the `:id` parameter placeholder in the route definition.
