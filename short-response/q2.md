# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

SPAs offer faster navigation and a smoother user experience by loading content dynamically without full page reloads, reducing server load and improving interactivity. They are easier to maintain and scale due to simpler backend logic, but may require additional effort for SEO optimization compared to MPAs.
