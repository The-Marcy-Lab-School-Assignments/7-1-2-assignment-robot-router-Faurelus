# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

The "\*" path in React Router is typically used as a catch-all route, meaning it matches any URL that hasn't been matched by previous routes. This is useful when you want to render a specific component or handle certain logic for any unmatched routes, such as displaying a 404 page or redirecting to a default route. Use it to manage undefined routes gracefully within your application
