# Question

Suppose you have an app that sells phones. To view a single phone's details, the user navigates to `/phones/5` where the number `5` is the id of a particular phone.

There is a corresponding route defined to render the `PhoneDetails` component for a single phone id:

```jsx
<Route path="/phones/:id" element={<PhoneDetails />} />
```

Within the `PhoneDetails` component, `useParams` is used to extract the number 5. 

```jsx
const PhoneDetails = () => {
  const { id } = useParams();
  
  // code to render the phone details
}
```

What is the data type of `id`?
